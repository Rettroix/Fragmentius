You are now entering the Asteroid belt.
We are sensing fragment crystals at your current location.
A Guardian should be very close by if our calculations are correct.
However, for the time being you need to make sure you do not touch those asteroids.
Good luck.

You made it through the Asteroids....
But it doesn't look like the end yet!
