A crystal spinning in the centre of the universe.

It keeps all in this world together.

It needs not protection, as no being dares touch it.

Untill now.

*Demon enters scene, looks at crystal. Lasers apear from eyes,
crystal shakes violently.*

Nameless one, the galactic demon overlord, has found a way to harness
it's energy. 

To create a new world. A demon utopia.

The crystal rejects, it is much too powerful for the demon, shatering into three 
fragments.

Did nameless one think it would be so easy?

The Crystal knows, but it can not protect itself any longer.

Gather them commander, before it is too late.
